# Coxing Website – University Web Development Project

## Overview

This project was developed as part of a university module introducing web development. The assignment required building a simple, static website using only HTML and CSS to demonstrate an understanding of basic web technologies, document structure, and styling.

I chose to create a website about **coxing**, a role in rowing that I am personally involved in. This topic provided relevant and original content while allowing me to design a site around something I have direct experience with.

## Purpose

The aim of the assignment was to:

- Demonstrate a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS.
- Practice building a functional, multi-page website without the use of frameworks or templates.
- Explore how structure and styling work together in web development.

To challenge myself further, I chose to write the entire site using **Windows Notepad**. This decision meant working without syntax highlighting, auto-complete, or live preview features—encouraging a deeper understanding of the code and greater attention to detail.

## Features

- Multi-page layout (e.g. Home, About Coxing, Techniques, Contact)
- Handwritten HTML and CSS files
- Fully static website with internal navigation
- Custom styling using CSS, without the use of libraries or external tools

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Text editor: Windows Notepad

## Reflections

Creating this site from scratch was a valuable introduction to the fundamentals of web development. Writing everything manually helped reinforce proper syntax, structure, and styling rules. It also highlighted the importance of planning layout and content before beginning to code.
