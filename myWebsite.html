    <h1>Coxing</h1>
    <h2>The sport for the skinny with a Napolean complex</h2>

    <p>Coxing is a sport which is a sub-set of rowing. The cox of a boat acts as a coach, motivator, and steerer, working hard to control the crew and help them perform to their maximum potential. They have some number yet to be determined of key jobs, mainly because of job 'e':
</p>

    <ol type = "a">
      <li>Steering the fastest possible line</li>
      <li>Ensuring the health and wellbeing of all crew member</li>
      <li>Getting the highest athletic performance out of the athletes</li>
      <li>Working with the coach to run the session</li>
      <li>Being the coach's personal butler/man-slave, and doing any job they require, including but not limited to lending your mother to them so she can babysit their child while you race</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In case it wasn't clear, that final point is a true story. The image below shows the daughter Alex's mum had to look after while Alex raced (and won a Eurpoean title with) her father at European Master's Regatta 2023.

    <p>A lot of people try to say coxing isn't really a sport, as the coxes don't undertake any kind of athletic performance. To that I say, dear reader:
</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Why was I allowed to do coxing as my sixth form PE option? Is the logic of PE teachers not infallable?</li>
      <li>Have YOU ever tried to wrangle eight full grown men into doing what you want as a 5'3 woman?</li>
      <li>If weaving through a flock of angry, nesting swans whose only desire in life is to take you out is not a sport, why is running around bouncing a ball a sport?</li>
      <li>With the amount of my student loan I've wasted on tools, race fees, and ridiculous looking uni-suits, do you really want to try and tell me now that this craft that half my bank balance goes to isn't a sport?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now I've clearly convinced you that coxing is a sport with highly fulfiling and important jobs to do, here's a quick test to see if you'd make it as a cox. For each row, please circle the appropriate box.
</p>

    <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Question</th>
    <th>You'd be an excellent cox</th>
    <th>Maybe stick to the brainless side of rowing</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Are you so short that at Christmas your friends ask when Santa is calling you back to his workshop?</td>
    <td>They started in November last year</td>
    <td>No, I'm not an elf!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In your primary school reports, did your teacher consistently call you 'chatty' and 'easily led of topic by their peers'?</td>
    <td>Group work was where I THRIVED</td>
    <td>I was more of a 'would benefit from contributing more to class discussions' kind of kid.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When organising a group trip, what were the intervals between events on your schedule?</td>
    <td>30 minutes or less</td>
    <td>Schedule? We're on holiday!</td>
  </tr>
</table>

  <p> If you want more information about how to get started as a cox, or how to improve (if for some odd reason an actually good cox has stumbled upon this mess-I mean, this highly informative page), please check out these links to books where someone much more qualified than me can help you learn
  </p>

  <a href = 'https://www.amazon.co.uk/Short-Snarky-Guide-Coxing-Rowing/dp/1500906107'> The Short and Snarky Guide to Rowing and Coxing </a>
  <p><a href = 'https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rowing-Faster-2nd-Volker-Nolte/dp/0736090401' > Rowing Faster </a></p>
  
 <p> I have personally read all of these books, and would thoroughly recommend them. If you have time, between the three full days of coxing per week, working/studying, and actually having a life (although everyone knows coxes don't have those) </p>
